## Day 17 Homework - ToDo List
### Explorer Mode
- create a to do list application using HTML, SASS, JS, and JQ library
- at a minimum include a:
  - text field for user to create new todo lists
  - list of already created todos for the user to see
  - a button for each item on the list to delete it
- when the user enters a new ToDo, it should save to the za server
- when the page loads, app should GET all the todos stored on the server and display them in the list
- when the user clicks the delete button next to an item, it should delete it from the server
- sketch out application first
- write notes about WHAT happens and WHEN
- Do some data modeling before coding.
  - make mock data in JSON either on paper or in my notes

### Adventurer Mode  
- allow user to complete and un-complete them.
- data should stay either complete or not completed on the server when the user changes their status..

### Epic
- implement a filter to allow user to see only complete, only not complete, or all to do items
